-- ACTIVE TEXT POINTERS
--
--- @set_environment battle
--- @set_environment campaign
--- @set_environment frontend
--- @c active_pointer Active Text Pointers
--- @page text_pointer
--- @desc Active pointers are a particular style of @text_pointer, declared as a separate class with a cut-down interface. Visually, an active pointer appears as a text box with a close button and an enlarged pointer arrow with no connecting line. The pointer arrow appears in one of the four corners of the panel.
--- @desc Active pointers are always associated with a @uicomponent at which they visually point. While showing, the active pointer repeatedly polls the properties of this @uicomponent. Should the uicomponent move on-screen, become invisible, or be destroyed, the active pointer will automatically dismiss itself. From an implementation perspective active pointers are intended to be relatively 'fire and forget', requiring a minimum of manual setup in script.
--- @desc An active pointer will automatically immediately hide itself if any parent/ancestor of it, back to the ui root, is seen to play an animation called "hide". This generally occurs when the host panel (e.g. diplomacy panel) is closing.


--- @section Active Pointer Display Methods
--- @desc Once declared, an active pointer may be shown directly with @active_pointer:show. Alternatively, @active_pointer:show_when_ready may be used to show the pointer, which waits until the target uicomponent has stopped moving and become visible before the pointer is shown. @active_pointer:show_when_ready may optionally take a delay value, which imposes a grace period before the text pointer is shown, and a timeout period after which the function will stop trying to show the pointer. Default values for both of these can be set on the active pointer with @active_pointer:set_default_delay and @active_pointer:set_default_timeout.
--- @desc The active pointer interface also provides functionality to allow the pointer itself to manage being shown. @active_pointer:show_on_event may be used to specify a script event and condition on which the active pointer should attempt to display. Furthermore, @active_pointer:wait_for_active_pointer allows this active pointer to be enqueued behind another, so that the foreign active pointer must be shown before this one will attempt to display. One active pointer can wait for multiple other active pointers, which may themselves wait upon other active pointers and so-on.


--- @section Storing in Advice History
--- @desc By default, active pointers store a record when they are displayed in the advice history, and will not display if that record is present when @active_pointer:show is called again. This behaviour, which is enabled by default, requires that the active pointer name is unique amongst active pointers, as the name of the advice history flag is derived from the pointer name.
--- @desc This functionality can be disabled when calling @active_pointer:new by setting the suppress-record boolean argument to <code>true</code>. When this is set to <code>false</code> the active pointer need not have a unique name, but advanced functionality like @active_pointer:show_on_event and @active_pointer:wait_for_active_pointer will not be available.

--- @section Creation
----------------------------------------------------------------------------


--- @function new
--- @desc Creates and returns a new active text pointer object.
--- @p @string name, Name for this text pointer. If this pointer is storing a record in the advice history (which is the default behaviour, and must be opted-out of by setting this suppress record in advice argument to <code>true</code> on this function) then the supplied name must be unique.
--- @p @string orientation, Orientation of the pointer arrow that is drawn. Supported values are <code>"topleft"</code>, <code>"topright"</code>, <code>"bottomleft"</code> and <code>"bottomright"</code>.
--- @p @uicomponent/@function uicomponent specifier, Specifier of uicomponent to point at. This can either be a @uicomponent object or a @function that returns a uicomponent. It's strongly recommended that if the text pointer is not being displayed immediately after being created that a function is used.
--- @p @string text key, Localised text key to display, in <code>[table]_[field]_[key]</code> format.
--- @p [opt=0.5] @number x proportion, Unary x proportion specifying a pointed position relative to the dimensions of the specified component. Supply <code>0</code> to point at the left edge of the component, <code>1</code> to point at the right edge of the component, or 0.5 to point at the middle of the component, for example. Values less than zero or greater than one are valid.
--- @p [opt=0.5] @number y proportion, Unary y proportion specifying a pointed position relative to the dimensions of the specified component. Supply <code>0</code> to point at the top edge of the component, <code>1</code> to point at the bottom edge of the component, or <code>0.5</code> to point at the middle of the component, for example. Values less than zero or greater than one are valid.
--- @p [opt=250] @number width, Width of the text pointer panel in pixels.
--- @p [opt=false] @boolean suppress record, Sets this active pointer to not record a record of whether it's been triggered in advice history. If this is set to <code>true</code> then the active pointer is not registered with the script core, and it doesn't need to have a unique name. However, the active pointer will not be able to automatically listen for events.

--- @section Hide on Event
--- @desc While being displayed, the active pointer polls its target uicomponent and will automatically hide itself once the target uicomponent moves or becomes invisible. Due to the inherent delay when polling with a model timer, in certain circumstances there is a visible delay before the text pointer hides. @active_pointer:add_hide_on_event_record can be used to make the active pointer directly respond to script events and hide itself before its poll picks up on a ui state change.

If the event is received while the active pointer is being shown, and the optional conditional check passes, then the active pointer is hidden. An optional flag specifies whether this hide should happen immediately, without any fade animation.
--- @p @string event name, Script event name.
--- @p [opt=true] @function/@boolean condition, Conditional check. This can be a function that returns a boolean, or <code>true</code> to always pass when the supplied event is received.

--- @section Managed Triggering
--- @desc These functions are only supported when the active pointer is set to store its use in the advice history - see the @"active_pointer:Storing in Advice History" section for more information.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------


--- @function wait_for_active_pointer
--- @desc Prevents this active pointer from being shown before another active pointer has been shown. An active pointer may wait for multiple other active pointers, each wait being registered with a call to this function. Should multiple waits be set up for an active pointer, it will fail to display until all active pointers being waited for have finished showing.
--- @desc This function sets up an @active_pointer:show_after_active_pointer process automatically, which attempts to show this pointer once the active pointer being waited for is dismissed.
--- @desc This active pointer must have registered itself in the advice history for this function to work.
--- @p @string active pointer name, Name of active pointer to wait for. The active pointer being waited for must have registered itself in the advice history.
--- @p [opt=0] @number delay override, Delay override, which will be supplied to @active_pointer:show_when_ready if this monitor tries to show the pointer. This is the delay between the uicomponent stopping moving/becoming visible and the text pointer actually being shown. This should be supplied in seconds in campaign, and in milliseconds in battle and the frontend. The default value is 1 second, or 1000ms, or whatever has been set with @active_pointer:set_default_delay.
--- @p [opt=0] @number timeout override, Timeout period override, which will be supplied to @active_pointer:show_when_ready if this monitor tries to show the pointer. The timeout is the elapsed period after which the show_when_ready process will halt if the target uicomponent has not stopped moving or become visible. In campaign this should be supplied in seconds, and defaults to either 5 or whatever value has been set with @active_pointer:set_default_timeout. In battle and the frontend, the timeout period is set in milliseconds and defaults to 5000.

--- @function show_after_active_pointer
--- @desc Sets up a listener that attempts to show this active pointer once the specified active pointer closes. Unlike @active_pointer:wait_for_active_pointer this doesn't demand that the specified active pointer must have first been shown before this active pointer can be shown - this active pointer could trigger before the specified active pointer (from a different event, for example).
