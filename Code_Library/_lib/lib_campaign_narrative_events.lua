-- NARRATIVE EVENTS
--
--- @set_environment campaign
--
--- @c narrative_event Narrative Events
--
--- @desc For an overview of the narrative events system see the @narrative topic page.
--- @desc Narrative events package a mission with some advice or narrative content, wrapped in an @intervention. They are designed to aid the creation of early-game missions, which commonly have to show a mission with some advice and occasionally a camera movement. They can also be used as a container to deliver other content like cutscenes, fullscreen movies etc.
--- @desc Once created, a narrative event may be associated with one or more a number of trigger messages that determine when it should trigger. See the @"narrative_event:Trigger Conditions" section for more information. Preconditions may be also be set which the narrative event must pass before it can trigger - see @"narrative_event:Preconditions". Preconditions can fire script messages when they fail.
--- @desc On-issued and on-mission-completed script messages may be specified - see the @"narrative_event:Scripted Messages" section. Script messages may be triggered when a) the narrative event object triggers its mission/advice and b) when the mission is completed. The intention is that these may be listened for by other narrative objects, so that the completion or triggering of one leads to the triggering of another.
--- @desc Once set up, the listeners associated with a narrative event must be started with @narrative_event:start.
--- @desc By default, narrative events will attempt to reduce the intrusiveness of advice, including not delivering the advice at all, if it's detected that the advice has been delivered before. This typically occurs when the player is experiencing the same narrative event on subsequent campaign playthroughs. See the @"narrative_event:Narrative Event Categories" section for more information.
--- @desc Narrative events may be declared and supported in multiplayer mode, but their content delivery will not be wrapped in an @intervention and no advice will be shown.
--- @desc Narrative events output diagnostic information on the <code>Lua - Narrative</code> console spool.

--- @section Payload Inheritance
--- @desc Narrative events may be set to inherit mission reward payloads from other narrative events, if that other narrative event has not yet triggered by the time the first does. This is to allow chains of narrative missions set up where individual missions can be bypassed without the player losing out on the reward that mission would bring.
--- @desc Consider two narrative events that encapsulate missions, one to recruit an agent and another to use an agent against an enemy target. Neither has yet triggered. The agent-action mission, which triggers when an agent is recruited, would naturally lead on from the first, but not in all cases - the player may be gifted an agent from an incident or other scripted event. By setting the agent-action mission to inherit the rewards of the recruit-agent mission, the rewards of the now-redundant recruit-agent mission will be rolled in to the agent-action mission, meaning the player is not penalised for having inadvertantly skipped a mission before it can trigger.
--- @desc If the narrative event being inherited from has already triggered then those rewards are not inherited. Should one narrative event inherit the rewards of another, that second narrative event will shut down and be unable to trigger.

--- @section Camera Scrolling
--- @desc A scroll-camera target may be set with @narrative_event:set_camera_scroll_target_callback. This specifies a target region, character or position to which the camera is scrolled when the mission and advice are shown.
--- @desc If the narrative event has been seen before in the advice history, it may decide not to scroll the camera even when a scroll-camera target has been set. See the @"narrative_event:Narrative Event Categories" section for more information.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------


--- @function set_camera_scroll_target_callback
--- @desc Sets a camera scroll target callback. This function will be stored and then later called when the narrative event is triggered. It should return either a @string, a @number or a @table that specifies a scroll target for the narrative event. Note that the narrative event may decide not to scroll the camera in any case due to advice settings, in which case this function would not be called - see the documentation for @"narrative_event:Narrative Event Categories" for more information.
--- @desc If the function returns a @string, a region is looked up with this key and, if found, the region's settlement is used as the camera scroll target. If no region is found then a faction is looked up with the key. If found, the closest military force from the faction to the camera is used for the scroll target.
--- @desc If the function returns a @number then it is assumed to be a character command queue index value. The character looked up by this cqi is used as the camera scroll target.
--- @desc The function may also return an indexed @table that specifies a display position e.g. <code>{100, 200}</code>.
--- @desc If the function returns @nil or any of the above queries fail then no scroll target is set.

This could be used to allow the intervention to play before a battle sequence has been completed or when a fullscreen panel is showing, for example.

Configuration callbacks will be passed the intervention object as a single argument, which they can then make configuration calls upon.
--- @desc Setting a configuration callback allows calling scripts to tailor aspects of the intervention's presentation, such as allowing it to trigger over the top of fullscreen panels or not on the player's turn.

-- NARRATIVE QUERIES
--
--- @c narrative_query Narrative Queries
--- @page narrative_event
--
--- @desc For an overview of the narrative events system see the @narrative topic page.
--- @desc Narrative queries represent decision points within a narrative structure. When triggered, a narrative query will run a supplied function query and may trigger script messages depending upon the result. Other narrative objects listening for those messages can then act upon the result of the query. See the page about the @script_messager for more information about script messages (they are different-but-equivalent to script events).
--- @desc All the data associated with a narrative query is supplied to it when it's constructed. Of particular note is the query records data structure - see the documentation of @narrative_query:new for more information.
--- @desc Once constructed, a narrative query is started by calling @narrative_query:start. This starts its internal trigger listeners.
--- @desc A narrative query triggers when it receives one of the trigger messages specified on creation (and the faction information contained in the message context matches the faction registered with the narrative query). At this point, all query functions supplied to the narrative event will be run, in order of registration. Each function will be passed the message context supplied to the narrative query as a first argument and the narrative query itself as a second. The query function can use the narrative query object to store data that other query functions that are about execute can read, if required.
--- @desc For any query that passes (i.e. the query function returns true) the related pass script message is triggered. Where a query doesn't pass, and a fail message was specified in the query setup, that fail message is triggered.
--- @desc Unlike @narrative_event and @narrative_trigger objects, narrative queries are stateless and do not save any information into the savegame. This means that any narrative query can trigger multiple times. The narrative event framework is designed so that narrative events and triggers should only be issued once, however, so this should be avoided.
--- @desc Narrative queries should work as expected in multiplayer mode.
--- @desc Narrative queries output diagnostic information on the <code>Lua - Narrative</code> console spool.

--- @section Deferring

At a later time @narrative_query:retrigger may be called, which re-runs the query. In the interim, scripts can have prepared the information that the query needs to successfully complete.

--
-- NARRATIVE TRIGGERS
--
--- @c narrative_trigger Narrative Triggers
--- @page narrative_event
--
--- @desc For an overview of the narrative events system see the @narrative topic page.
--- @desc Narrative triggers monitor game conditions in order to trigger other objects within the narrative system. All narrative events, or chains of narrative events, should ultimately be started by a narrative trigger.
--- @desc One or more game script event/condition checks are registered with the narrative trigger either as it's created with @narrative_trigger:new or later with @narrative_trigger:add_monitor_event. When the narrative trigger is subsequently started when @narrative_trigger:start is called, it starts a listener for each supplied event/condition and, if the event is received and the related condition is met, triggers one or more script messages that can start other objects in the narrative event system. Narrative triggers can also listen for script messages to know when to trigger - these can be added with @narrative_trigger:add_monitor_message - although it's intended that narrative triggers should primarily listen for script events rather than messages.
--- @desc Note the distinction between script messages and script events - while narrative triggers can listen for script events and messages from the game (or other scripts) to know when to trigger, the communication with other narrative objects happens exclusively with script messages. Script messages are a script-only parallel mechanism to script events, see the @script_messager documentation for more information.
--- @desc In most cases, all data relevant to the narrative trigger is supplied during construction, when @narrative_trigger:new is called. Additional script events/conditions to monitor can be added after creation by calling @narrative_trigger:add_monitor_event.
--- @desc Once created, a narrative trigger will begin its monitors when @narrative_trigger:start is called. Like narrative events and queries, narrative triggers are intended to only trigger once per-campaign playthrough. If a narrative trigger finds in the savegame data that it has triggered before it will not start its listeners when @narrative_trigger:start is called.
--- @desc Narrative triggers should work in multiplayer mode. Narrative triggers should only listen for model game events in multiplayer mode to allow scripts on different physical machines to maintain synchronicity.
--- @desc Like other narrative objects, narrative triggers output diagnostic information on the <code>Lua - Narrative</code> console spool.
--
--- @section Deferred Triggering
--- @desc Invididual event/condition pairs can be set up to trigger immediately or not. Should an event/condition pair not be set up to trigger immediately then the narrative trigger will fire its trigger messages(s) within an intervention, which means that the message may not be triggered straight away. This can help reduce the intrusiveness of the narrative event system by spacing out the delivery of narrative events over time.
--- @desc In multiplayer mode, where interventions are not supported, trigger messages are always fired immediately.
--
--- @section Start and Cancel Messages
--- @desc Narrative triggers may also be set up with start messages. Should one or more start message be registered then the narrative trigger will not start its main event/condition monitoring process until a start message is received from another object within the narrative event system. This can be useful in certain circumstances, for example to listen for the start of a particular faction's turn but only after another mission in the narrative event system has completed. If no start messages are specified the narrative trigger starts its main monitoring process immediately when narrative_trigger:start is called.
--- @desc Cancel messages may also be set up for narrative triggers. These allow other narrative objects to cancel the trigger's main monitoring process, which can be used to stop a trigger from firing if some other condition is met within the narrative event system.

--- @section Creation
----------------------------------------------------------------------------


--- @function new
--- @desc Creates and returns a narrative trigger object. As with all narrative objects a unique name and faction key to which the trigger applies must be supplied.
--- @desc The main events and conditions table must be an indexed table containing one or more subtables for each event/condition pair. Each subtable should contain elements at the following keys:
--- @desc <table class="simple"><tr><th>Key</th><th>Data Description</th></tr>
--- @desc <tr><td><code>event</code></td><td>Game event to listen for. This should be a model event and not a UI event to prevent the game desynchronising in multiplayer mode.</td></tr>
--- @desc <tr><td><code>condition</code></td><td>Condition check to perform at the time the related event is received. This should be a @function which returns a boolean value. When called, the function will be passed the event context and the narrative trigger object as two separate arguments.</p>In common with other event/condition systems elsewhere, the @boolean value <code>true</code> may be supplied here in place of a function, in which case the condition always passes.</td></tr>
--- @desc <tr><td><code>immediate</code></td><td><strong>Optional</strong> boolean value which, if set to true, forces the narrative trigger to fire its trigger events immediately if this event/condition pair pass. If this value is false or is not supplied, the target message(s) are fired in an intervention which can delay their issue. In multiplayer mode the target message(s) are always fired immediately.</li></td></tr>
--- @desc </table>
--- @desc See the @narrative_trigger:Usage section of this documentation for a declaration example.
--- @p @string name, Unique name amongst narrative query objects.
--- @p @string faction key, Key of faction, from the <code>factions</code> database table, this narrative query is related to.
--- @p @string target message, String message which this narrative trigger fires when any event/condition pair are met. This may also be a @table of multiple string message names, in which case all will be triggered.
--- @p [opt=nil] @table main event records, Main event and condition records. See the function documentation above for a description of the data format to supply here. This may be left blank, with main listeners added later using either @narrative_trigger:add_monitor_event or @narrative_trigger:add_monitor_message.
--- @p [opt=false] @string start message, Message on which to start this trigger's main event monitors. This can be supplied as a single string or a @table of multiple string message names.
--- @p_long_desc If no start messages are supplied then the narrative trigger will start its main event monitors as soon as it is started.
--- @p [opt=false] @string cancel messages, Narrative messages on which to cancel the narrative trigger. This can be supplied as a single string or a @table of multiple string message names.
--- @p [opt=60] @number intervention priority, Priority at which to trigger the internal @intervention object, if one is declared. See intervention documentation for more information about intervention priorities.
