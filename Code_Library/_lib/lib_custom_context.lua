--- @c custom_context Custom Context
--- @page core
--- @desc A custom context is created when the core object is compelled to trigger an event with @core:trigger_event or @core:trigger_custom_event. Data items supplied to @core:trigger_event or @core:trigger_custom_event are added to the custom context, which is then sent to any script listening for the event being triggered.
--- @desc The receiving script should then be able to interrogate the custom context it receives as if it were a context issued from the game code.
--- @desc No script outside of <code>trigger_event</code> should need to create a custom context, but it's documented here in order to list the data types it supports.

--- @desc <li>region: will be accessible to the receiving script using @custom_context:region.</li>
--- @desc <li>character: will be accessible to the receiving script using @custom_context:character. A second character, if added, is accessible to the receiving script using @custom_context:target_character.</li>
--- @desc <li>faction: will be accessible to the receiving script using @custom_context:faction.</li>
