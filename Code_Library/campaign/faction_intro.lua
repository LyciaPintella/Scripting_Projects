--- @data_interface faction_intro Faction Intro
--- @desc Provides the system used to define the cutscenes and start-of-game dressing that fires for a given faction, in a given campaign, and under other conditions.
--- @desc Faction Intro data is defined in the folder of each campaign, under a 'faction_intro' folder. Multiple faction intros can be defined, and will be merged together, allowing for mod compatibility.
--- @desc The Faction Intro system allows an inherited 'preset' system. For example, if lots of factions share the same intro cutscene, that cutscene could be defined as a preset, with each faction intro inheriting from that preset. If one of those factions also had different potential leaders, requiring different advisor voice lines or a different camera position for each one, then that can be defined with variant tables.
---
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- @section How to Use
--- @desc To create your own set of faction-intro data for a given campaign, create a faction_intro folder under that campaign's script folder. e.g. <code>script/campaign/main_warhammer/faction_intro/</code>
--- @desc Scripts placed in this folder must define campaign-intro data, such as initial camera positions and cutscenes. These scripts can have any names, and multiple can be used. The Faction Intro system will load them all and merge them together.
--- @desc The scripts must take the following structure:
--- @new_example
--- @desc An example of a faction intro Lua file.
--- @example local data = {
--- @example 	-- Load order defines the order in which each of these tables is loaded, with later loads overwriting the elements of earlier ones.
--- @example 	-- If this isn't defined, a script will always load last.
--- @example 	-- If two scripts have an equal load-order, the order becomes alphabetical, based on script name.
--- @example 	load_order = 0,
--- @example 	-- A list of functions used to define how a faction's variant might be inferred. A typical example would be determining if we're playing as Karl Franz or Volkmar the Grimm.
--- @example 	variant_key_getters = {
--- @example 		-- ...
--- @example 	},
--- @example 	-- You can use presets to define bits of intro data which are used by lots of factions.
--- @example 	intro_presets = {
--- @example 		theatre_empire = {
--- @example 			cam_gameplay_start = {
--- @example 				x = 402,

--- @example 		},
--- @example 	},
--- @example }
--- @example 
--- @example -- This table provides the actual intro data for each faction.

--- @section Faction Intro Presets
--- @desc A preset is a template of faction intro data which other tables can inherit from. If all factions in a given culture need to use the same introductory cutscene, for example, it can be defined on a preset. Then each faction's <code>preset</code> entry can be set to the @string key of that preset.
--- @desc Presets are defiend in a faction intro data file and, as with the faction intro definitions themselves, can be re-defined or overriden in multiple files, allowing for mod compatibility.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- @section Variants
--- @desc Variants allow a particular faction to have multiple possible introduction data sets.
--- @desc The trigger to use either one variant or another is user-defined: it might use the faction's starting-lord, as a way of handling cases where a faction can be lead by different leaders.
--- @desc Or it might play different voice lines and cutscenes based on the game's difficulty.
--- @desc Variant triggers must be defined using the <code>faction_intro.variant_key_getters</code> table.
--- @new_example Variant Key Getter Example
--- @desc In this example, we construct a variant key using the quantity of players in the game, which is used to adjust the advisor voicelines.
--- @example local data = {
--- @example 	-- Conditions by which a faction can provide a variant key are defined here. You may want to use the presence of a given effect bundle as a reason to have a particular intro to play, for example.
--- @example 	-- Criteria are executed in priority of first to last: if an earlier getter is satisfied and provides a non-nil variant key, then later getters will not be consulted.
--- @example 	variant_key_getters = {

--- @section Faction Intro Cutscene Configurators
--- @desc If you want to define complicated custom routines for the intro cutscene, you can specify the <code>cutscene_configurator</code> on the faction intro.

--- @section Faction Intro Cutscene Styles
--- @desc If lots of your cutscenes for each faction are basically the same, but with slight differences, you can create a <code>cutscene style</code>.
--- @desc A cutscene style is a function which returns a <code>cutscene configurator</code> (which itself returns a cutscene ...). It takes a 'self' parameter (self being the faction intro config table).
