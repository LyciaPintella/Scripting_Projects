--	system.
--
--	LOADED
--	This file is loaded by wh3_narrative_loader.lua, which in turn should be loaded by the per-campaign narrative

--- @section Data Setup Callbacks
--- @desc Data setup callbacks for the narrative system may be added with @narrative:add_data_setup_callback. Callbacks added with this function are not called until @narrative:start is called, which doesn't happen until the first tick. This structure allows narrative data to be added as scripts are loaded (potentially before the model is loaded) and only quer


--- @function add_data_setup_callback
--- @desc Adds a callback which sets up data for the narrative system. The callback can make calls to functions such as @narrative:add_playable_faction and @narrative:add_data_for_faction to set up narrative override data.
--- @desc Callbacks added here will be called when @narrative:start is called.

--- @section Adding Data


--- @function add_playable_faction
--- @desc Adds a playable faction, by key, to the narrative data. Calls to this function should be made within setup functions that are passed to @narrative:add_data_setup_callback.
--- @desc Factions will need to be added to the narrative data with this function before any data can be added for them with @narrative:add_data_for_faction.
--- @p @string faction key
function narrative.add_playable_faction(faction_key)
	narrative.faction_data[faction_key] = {};
	out.narrative("Added faction " .. faction_key);

--- @function add_exception_faction
--- @desc Adds a playable faction, by key, to the narrative exception faction list data. Calls to this function should be made within setup functions that are passed to @narrative:add_data_setup_callback.
--- @desc Factions will need to be added to the exception list to skip some elements of the narrative data.

--- @function add_data_for_faction
--- @desc Adds a data override for a faction within the narrative system. Factions must have been added with @narrative:add_playable_faction before data overrides can be added for them.
--- @desc If @narrative:get is later called and the faction and data keys supplied to it match a data override, then the data associated with that override is returned. This can be used to override data keys for specific factions.
--- @desc Calls to @narrative:get should be made within the narrative event declarations.
