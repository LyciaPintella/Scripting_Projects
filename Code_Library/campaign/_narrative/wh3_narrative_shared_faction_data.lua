--	SHARED NARRATIVE FACTION DATA
--
--	PURPOSE
--	This file defines the base per-faction data related to narrative events.
--
--	As new playable cultures are added to the game, they will need to be added to this file. Errors should be generated
--	if they aren't.
--	
--	The create_base_narrative_faction_data() function which defines all base faction data is added
--	to the narrative system with a call to narrative.add_loader. The function will be called when the narrative system is started,
--	on or around the first tick.
--
--	LOADED
--	This file is loaded by wh3_narrative_loader.lua, which in turn should be loaded by the per-campaign narrative 
--	script file. It should get loaded on start of script.
