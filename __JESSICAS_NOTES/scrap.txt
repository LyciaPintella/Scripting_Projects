Expanded LSG Recruitment From Ports And Elven Colonies

This mod expands port recruitment of Lothern Sea Guard to allow them to be recruited at a maximum level regular port (T5 in vanilla), or from The second level (tier 3) of the special ports located in Lothern, Copher, Dragon Isle, Marienburg, and Erengrad.

Elven Colonies also get the shielded variant at level 4, though for the minor colony that means you will need a Tier 4 Minor Building Mod.

Alarielle's True Power of Nature!

This mod allows Alarielle to boost the entire Order Tide with Power of Nature. Included cultures: High Elves (duh), Lizardmen, Grand Cathay, Kislev, Wood Elves, Bretonnia, The Empire, and the Dawi.

Tip: Ally with her and use the war coordination system to tell her to defend different regions one after another and she will do the rounds!

[b]Note: This is included in:  [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2977110097]Alarielle's Global World Torment And True Power of Nature Combined[/url]. Trying to load both mods together will break something, somewhere![/b]



All I did was add hidden/disabled definitions for tier 4 minor settlements. Are you using a minor settlement mod? What happens if you load up without it? If you are using one, which one are you using? (So I can look at it).

I know this mod isn't crashing on it's own because I can run it for hours. I need to know WHICH other mod you are using so I can figure out why my change broke it.
