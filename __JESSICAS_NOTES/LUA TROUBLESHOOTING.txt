Quick tip you might be aware of already: if you work on a data/script folder for scripting instead of having it in a pack, you can make changes to the scripts and reload the campaign to reload the scripts :p  You can hit Ctrl+L and have your scripts reloaded.

Something I learnt today ^^ Until now, I was quitting the game and starting it up each time I made a change to the devtool. This significantly reduce the feedback loop ðŸ‘Œ
local duration, wins, losses = war_stats["duration"], war_stats["wins"], war_stats["losses"];

in_power_of_nature:add_trigger_condition(
	"ScriptEventPowerOfNatureTriggered",
	function()
		return true;
	end
);
